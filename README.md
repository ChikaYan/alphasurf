## Setup

First create the virtualenv; we recommend using conda:
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate alphasurf
```

Then install pytorch with CUDA support via:

```sh
conda install pytorch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio==0.11.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```


Then install the C++/CUDA extension at root by simply running

```
pip install .
```
In the repo root directory.

If your CUDA toolkit is older than 11, then you will need to install CUB as follows:
`conda install -c bottler nvidiacub`.
Since CUDA 11, CUB is shipped with the toolkit.

## Train and eval

An example script for training Plenoxels + our method is avaliable at train_eval.sh

```
bash train_eval.sh
```
